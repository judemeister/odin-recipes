    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let us show you how to make cheesecake that's baked to perfection, firm and fudgy with a tangy topping, flavoured with vanilla and strawberries. Because once you learn this you'll have friends for life.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>125g/4Â½oz unsalted butter</li>
        <li>250g/9oz digestive biscuits</li>
        <li>3 eggs and 2 egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a gentle heat. Brush a little of the melted butter around the base and sides of a 23cm/9in springform tin, then line the base with a circle of baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Put the biscuits into a large sealable freezer bag, squeeze out the air and seal the top. Use a rolling pin, or a bottle, to crush the biscuits to fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir the crumbs into the melted butter until completely combined. Press the crumbs into the tin. Use the back of the spoon to compact the crumbs as much as you can in an even layer. Put into the fridge to firm up while you make the cheesecake, roughly 30 mins - 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
